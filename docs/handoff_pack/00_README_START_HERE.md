# Handoff Pack - Start Here

**Generated**: 2026-02-03  
**Purpose**: Complete knowledge transfer for new agent working on Barnum Clinic Management Platform

---

## Single Source of Truth

**`ChatGPT_5.2_context.md`** (root directory) is the **canonical living context file**.  
All other documentation should be cross-referenced against it.

---

## What This Pack Contains

This handoff pack provides everything a new agent needs to start working on this project immediately:

1. **Project Snapshot** - Tech stack, entities, current phase
2. **Decisions & Rationale** - Why things are the way they are
3. **Status Board** - What's DONE, IN PROGRESS, or OPEN
4. **Local Dev Runbook** - How to run/test locally
5. **Docs Map** - Where to find what, what to trust

---

## Reading Order (Recommended)

**For immediate execution**:
1. Start here: `00_README_START_HERE.md` (this file)
2. Get context: `01_PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md`
3. Check status: `03_STATUS_BOARD.md`
4. Run locally: `04_RUNBOOK_LOCAL_DEV.md`

**For deeper understanding**:
5. Read decisions: `02_DECISIONS_AND_RATIONALE.md`
6. Navigate docs: `05_DOCS_MAP.md`
7. Study canonical context: `../ChatGPT_5.2_context.md`

---

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

1. **Read**: `01_PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md` (2 min) - Know what you're working on
2. **Check**: `03_STATUS_BOARD.md` (2 min) - See what's already done
3. **Run**: `04_RUNBOOK_LOCAL_DEV.md` (1 min to start dev server)

---

## Critical Rules

### Documentation Hierarchy
1. **`ChatGPT_5.2_context.md`** - PRIMARY source of truth
2. **`docs/contracts/FRONTEND_STABILIZATION_BACKLOG.md`** - Issue tracking
3. **This handoff pack** - Quick reference
4. Everything else - Supporting/historical

### Working Principles
- **Never modify production** - All work is local only
- **Evidence-based** - Don't invent schema/routes/tables
- **Mark UNKNOWN** - If you don't know, say so
- **Follow phases** - Audit → Fix → Validate → Document

### Phase Completion Checklist
Every phase must update:
- [ ] Code files (if applicable)
- [ ] `ChatGPT_5.2_context.md` (add phase section)
- [ ] Status docs (`FRONTEND_STABILIZATION_BACKLOG.md`)
- [ ] Create/update walkthrough in artifacts

## Who to Collaborate With

**External coordinator**: ChatGPT 5.2  
**Environment**: Windows PC (different from where this pack was created)  
**Expectation**: Pick up where previous agent left off with zero context loss

---

## Emergency: If Something Is Wrong

1. **Check canonical context first**: `ChatGPT_5.2_context.md`
2. **Cross-reference with backlog**: `docs/contracts/FRONTEND_STABILIZATION_BACKLOG.md`
3. **If contradiction exists**: Trust `ChatGPT_5.2_context.md` (it's newer/living doc)
4. **If unknown**: Mark as UNKNOWN and ask coordinator

---

## Current Project Status (High-Level)

**Phase**: 5B.2 Complete (AppointmentWizard fix verified)  
**System State**: Fully operational for core admin workflows  
**Blockers**: None (all P0 and P1 fixed)  
**Next**: P2 minor issues or new feature work

See `03_STATUS_BOARD.md` for complete details.

---

## Next Steps

1. Read `01_PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md` to understand the project
2. Review `03_STATUS_BOARD.md` to see what needs doing
3. Follow `04_RUNBOOK_LOCAL_DEV.md` to get environment running
4. Coordinate with ChatGPT 5.2 on next task
